# Commerce library for the Shopgate Connect PWA

This library contains commerce modules for a shopping
[PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) in **Shopgate Connect**.

It contains everything necessary for the redux data storage to deal with products, categories,
search results, filters, orders, the cart and the checkout.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @shopgate/pwa-common-commerce --save
```

Installing this package will automatically bring the

[@shopgate/pwa-common](https://github.com/shopgate/pwa/tree/master/libraries/common) into your
